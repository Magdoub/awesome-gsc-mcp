## Quick Start

```bash
npx awesome-gsc-mcp
```

That's it. The server starts on stdio and is ready to connect to Claude Desktop or Claude Code. You just need valid Google credentials (see [Installation & Setup](#installation--setup)).

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Get Google Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable the [Search Console API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/searchconsole.googleapis.com)

4. Create credentials:
   - Go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**
   - Create a service account, name it anything, click continue

   <img width="500" alt="Create service account" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2474e4a0-51d4-439d-92a2-f30591f6843c" />

   - Open the service account and go to the **Keys** tab

   <img width="500" alt="Open service account" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c517ed72-2f07-46bd-8893-f80ec367b9cd" />

   - Click **Add Key > Create New Key** and select JSON

   <img width="500" alt="Add key menu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca62cdda-7008-43d9-bc14-fb379206ff49" />

   <img width="500" alt="Download JSON key" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d4cedf-82c5-4ab7-b624-f9ff3d0b92ce" />

5. Grant access:
   - Open [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
   - Go to [**Settings > Users and permissions**](https://search.google.com/search-console/users)
   - Add the service account email as an **Owner**

### 2. Configure Your Client

Add to your MCP client config:

| Client | Config file |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Claude Code | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awesome-gsc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "awesome-gsc-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "/path/to/service-account-key.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Replace `/path/to/service-account-key.json` with the actual path to the key file you downloaded in step 1.

<details>
<summary><strong>OAuth (alternative to service account)</strong></summary>

If you prefer OAuth for individual use instead of a service account:

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**, select **Desktop app**
3. Download the client secrets JSON file
4. Use this env var instead:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "GSC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE": "/path/to/client-secrets.json"
  }
}
```

On first run the server opens a browser for authorization. Tokens are cached at `~/.awesome-gsc-mcp/token.json` and auto-refreshed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other install methods</strong></summary>

**Global install:**

```bash
npm install -g awesome-gsc-mcp
```

Then use `"command": "awesome-gsc-mcp"` and `"args": []` in your config.

**As a project dependency:**

```bash
npm install awesome-gsc-mcp
```

Then use `"command": "node"` and `"args": ["./node_modules/.bin/awesome-gsc-mcp"]` in your config.

**Credentials as env string** (useful for CI/CD):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY": "{\"type\":\"service_account\",\"project_id\":\"...\",\"private_key\":\"...\"}"
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

| Error | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `401 Token has been expired or revoked` | Delete `~/.awesome-gsc-mcp/token.json` and re-authorize |
| `403 User does not have sufficient permission` | Add the service account email as **Owner** in Search Console > [Settings > Users and permissions](https://search.google.com/search-console/users) |
| `403 Forbidden` with OAuth | Add yourself as a test user in Google Cloud Console > OAuth consent screen, or publish the app |
| `Could not load the default credentials` | Check that `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` points to a valid key file |

## Analysis Engine

<details>
<summary><strong>Built-in SEO analysis beyond raw data</strong></summary>

The server goes beyond raw data with a built-in analysis engine:

- **CTR Benchmarks** -- Compares your click-through rates against industry-average benchmarks by position. Flags pages that underperform and estimates how many additional clicks you could gain.
- **Trend Detection** -- Analyzes time-series data to detect upward, downward, or stable trends across your queries and pages.
- **Query Classification** -- Classifies queries by user intent (informational, investigational, transactional, navigational, problem-solving) and sub-type (how-to, comparison, review, error/fix, and more).
- **Opportunity Scoring** -- Scores every opportunity by traffic impact potential, factoring in impressions, CTR gap, position proximity, and volume.
- **Recommendation Engine** -- Generates specific, prioritized recommendations based on the data patterns found in your property.

</details>

---

## API Limitations

<details>
<summary><strong>What's not available through the API</strong></summary>

The Google Search Console API has known limitations. The following data is **not available** through the API and therefore not provided by this server:

- **Core Web Vitals** -- Page experience and performance metrics
- **Crawl Stats** -- Crawl requests, response times, host status
- **Manual Actions** -- Penalties and security issues
- **Links Report** -- Internal and external link data
- **Removals** -- URL removal requests
- **Rich Results** -- Detailed rich result reports (basic info is available via URL Inspection)

These reports are only available in the Search Console web interface.

</details>

---

## HTTP Transport

<details>
<summary><strong>Using HTTP instead of stdio</strong></summary>

For environments that prefer HTTP over stdio, start the server with the `--http` flag:

```bash
npx awesome-gsc-mcp --http
```

The server listens on port 3000 by default. Override with the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=8080 npx awesome-gsc-mcp --http
```

Endpoints:

| Path | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/mcp` | POST | MCP protocol endpoint (Streamable HTTP transport) |
| `/health` | GET | Health check -- returns `{"status":"ok","auth":"..."}` |

</details>

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Common questions</strong></summary>

**How often does GSC data update?**
Search Console data typically has a 2–3 day delay. For settled, final numbers pass `dataState: 'final'` in your search analytics queries. The most recent 2–3 days may still change as Google processes data.

**What are the rate limits?**
The server has built-in rate limiting at 20 requests/second with a burst allowance of 30. The Google Search Console API also has its own daily quota — check your [Google Cloud Console quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/searchconsole.googleapis.com/quotas) if you hit limits.

**Can I work with multiple sites?**
Yes. Use `list_properties` to see all accessible sites, then specify the `siteUrl` parameter in any tool to target a specific property.

**How do domain properties work?**
Domain properties use the `sc-domain:example.com` format. This covers all subdomains and protocols. URL-prefix properties use the full URL like `https://www.example.com/`.

**What data is NOT available through the API?**
See the [API Limitations](#api-limitations) section. Core Web Vitals, crawl stats, links, manual actions, and removals are only available in the Search Console web interface.
